For the above HDMI device, because the frame rate is 60, so we modify the framerate parameter to 60 like the followint command. Record the video only: gst-launch-1.0 -vvv v4l2src ! \"video/x-raw,framerate=60/1,format=UYVY\" ! v4l2h264enc extra-controls=\"controls,h264_profile=4,h264_level=13,video_bitrate=256000;\" ! \"video/x-h264,profile=high, level=(string)4.2\" ! h264parse ! queue ! matroskamux name=mux ! filesink location=foo.mkv Record the video and audio: (if your shield supports audio also) gst-launch-1.0 -vvv v4l2src ! \"video/x-raw,framerate=60/1,format=UYVY\" ! v4l2h264enc extra-controls=\"controls,h264_profile=4,h264_level=13,video_bitrate=256000;\" ! \"video/x-h264,profile=high, level=(string)4.2\" ! h264parse ! queue ! matroskamux name=mux ! filesink location=foo.mkv alsasrc device=hw:1 ! audio/x-raw,rate=48000,channels=2 ! audioconvert ! avenc_aac bitrate=48000 ! aacparse ! queue ! mux. Note: alsasrc device=hw:1 \u2013 \u201c1\u201d means the audio card number, You must change to correct audio card number.

Use gstreamer to record video and audio #GStreamer v1.14 command gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src io-mode=5 ! video/x-raw, format=UYVY, framerate=25/1 ! v4l2h264enc output-io-mode=4 ! video/x-h264,profile=high ! h264parse ! queue ! matroskamux name=mux ! filesink location=foo.mkv alsasrc device=hw:1 ! audio/x-raw,rate=48000,channels=2 ! audioconvert ! avenc_aac bitrate=48000 ! aacparse ! queue ! mux. foo.mkv is the output file. If your gstreamer is version 1.8 or above, you can try the following test command. In addition, alsasrc device=hw:1 represents the sound card of TC358743, you can use \u201carecord -l\u201d to query. #The command to recode a video with audio. (GStreamer 1.18.4) gst-launch-1.0 -vvv v4l2src ! \"video/x-raw,framerate=30/1,format=UYVY\" ! v4l2h264enc extra-controls=\"controls,h264_profile=4,h264_level=13,video_bitrate=256000;\" ! \"video/x-h264,profile=high, level=(string)4.2\" ! h264parse ! queue ! matroskamux name=mux ! filesink location=foo.mkv alsasrc device=hw:1 ! audio/x-raw,rate=48000,channels=2 ! audioconvert ! avenc_aac bitrate=48000 ! aacparse ! queue ! mux. #The sample command to recode a video without audio. (C779 doesn't support audio) gst-launch-1.0 -vvv v4l2src ! \"video/x-raw,framerate=30/1,format=UYVY\" ! v4l2h264enc extra-controls=\"controls,h264_profile=4,h264_level=13,video_bitrate=256000;\" ! \"video/x-h264,profile=high, level=(string)4.2\" ! h264parse ! queue ! matroskamux name=mux ! filesink location=foo.mkv Press CTRL+C to end recording. PS: We recommend that you modify the above framerate parameter to the actual frame rate of your HDMI signal, the actual frame rate value is from the result of \u2018v4l2-ctl \u2013query-dv-timings\u2019 command. For the above HDMI device, because the frame rate is 60, so we modify the framerate parameter to 60 like the followint command. Record the video only: gst-launch-1.0 -vvv v4l2src ! \"video/x-raw,framerate=60/1,format=UYVY\" ! v4l2h264enc extra-controls=\"controls,h264_profile=4,h264_level=13,video_bitrate=256000;\" ! \"video/x-h264,profile=high, level=(string)4.2\" ! h264parse ! queue ! matroskamux name=mux ! filesink location=foo.mkv Record the video and audio: (if your shield supports audio also) gst-launch-1.0 -vvv v4l2src ! \"video/x-raw,framerate=60/1,format=UYVY\" ! v4l2h264enc extra-controls=\"controls,h264_profile=4,h264_level=13,video_bitrate=256000;\" ! \"video/x-h264,profile=high, level=(string)4.2\" ! h264parse ! queue ! matroskamux name=mux ! filesink location=foo.mkv alsasrc device=hw:1 ! audio/x-raw,rate=48000,channels=2 ! audioconvert ! avenc_aac bitrate=48000 ! aacparse ! queue ! mux. Note: alsasrc device=hw:1 \u2013 \u201c1\u201d means the audio card number, You must change to correct audio card number. (Query the car number via \u2018arecord \u2013l\u2019, refer to step 9)","title":"Software demo"},{"location":"hdmi-csi-i2s/#packing-list","text":"C790","title":"Packing List"},{"location":"hdmi-csi-i2s/#test-video","text":"C780A test:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecqyINoiHNQ C780B test:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc-hwPT2Uak&t=15s","title":"Test video"},{"location":"hdmi-csi-i2s/#purchase-link","text":"Purchase\uff1a C790 & C780 Purchase\uff1a C779","title":"Purchase link"},{"location":"usb-splitter-guide/","text":"USB/PWR Splitter guide 1.
